# PROGRAMMER: Gayatri Devi Guthula
# DATE CREATED: 11/07/2023                                
# REVISED DATE: 
# PURPOSE: Create a function classify_images that uses the classifier function 
#          to create the classifier labels and then compares the classifier 
#          labels to the pet image labels. This function inputs:
#            -The Image Folder as image_dir within classify_images and function 
#             and as in_arg.dir for function call within main. 
#            -The results dictionary as results_dic within classify_images 
#             function and results for the functin call within main.
#            -The CNN model architecture as model wihtin classify_images function
#             and in_arg.arch for the function call within main. 
#           This function uses the extend function to add items to the list 
#           that's the 'value' of the results dictionary. You will be adding the
#           classifier label as the item at index 1 of the list and the comparison 
#           of the pet and classifier labels as the item at index 2 of the list.

from classifier import classifier

def classify_images(images_dir, results_dic, model):
    """
    Creates classifier labels with the classifier function, compares pet labels to 
    the classifier labels, and adds the classifier label and the comparison of 
    the labels to the results dictionary using the extend function. Be sure to
    format the classifier labels so that they will match your pet image labels.
    The format will include putting the classifier labels in all lowercase 
    letters and strip the leading and trailing whitespace characters from them.
    For example, the Classifier function returns = 'Maltese dog, Maltese terrier, Maltese' 
    so the classifier label = 'maltese dog, maltese terrier, maltese'.
    Recall that dog names from the classifier function can be a string of dog 
    names separated by commas when a particular breed of dog has multiple dog 
    names associated with that breed. For example, you will find pet images of
    a 'dalmatian' (pet label) and it will match to the classifier label 
    'dalmatian, coach dog, carriage dog' if the classifier function correctly 
    classified the pet images of dalmatians.

    Parameters: 
      images_dir - The (full) path to the folder of images that are to be
                   classified by the classifier function (string)
      results_dic - Results Dictionary with 'key' as image filename and 'value'
                    as a List. Where the list will contain the following items: 
                  index 0 = pet image label (string)
                  NEW - index 1 = classifier label (string)
                  NEW - index 2 = 1/0 (int)  where 1 = match between pet image
                    and classifier labels and 0 = no match between labels
      model - Indicates which CNN model architecture will be used by the 
              classifier function to classify the pet images,
              values must be either: resnet alexnet vgg (string)
     Returns:
           None - results_dic is a mutable data type so no return is needed.         
    """
    # Iterate through the results_dic dictionary
    for key in results_dic:
        # Get the full path to the image file
        image_file = images_dir + key
        # Use the classifier function to classify the image
        classifier_label = classifier(image_file, model).lower().strip()
